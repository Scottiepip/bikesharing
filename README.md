For further analysis, since New York City is a major tourist attraction and a business hub, so situation for Des Moines might be different. So it will be good to analyze what type of crowd is attracted to Des Moines. And weather is also an important factor that might affect bike riding. It will be a good idea to analyze the weather in different months and see how it affect ride numbers, and trip durations etc.
